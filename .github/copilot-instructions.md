# GeneralStudy Project - AI Coding Agent Guide

## Project Overview
This is a general study workspace currently containing educational materials and documentation.

## Current Structure
- **Syllabus.docx**: Core curriculum/course outline document
- **.github/appmod/appcat/**: Directory structure prepared for future application modernization content

## Development Guidelines

### File Organization
- Keep educational materials and documentation at the root level
- Use `.github/` for project metadata and AI agent instructions
- Maintain `appmod/` subdirectory for application modernization resources

### Documentation Standards
- When creating new documents, prefer markdown (.md) format for version control compatibility
- Use clear, descriptive filenames that indicate content purpose
- Keep syllabus and course materials synchronized with actual content

## Future Enhancements
As this project grows, consider documenting:
- Build and test workflows when code is added
- Specific patterns or conventions for different study areas
- Dependencies and external resources used
- Cross-references between related materials

---
*This file should be updated as the project evolves to reflect actual patterns and workflows.*
